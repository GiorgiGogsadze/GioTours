It displays a set of tours offered by the travel company so that the user can first choose, and then get detailed information about each of them. During the selection process, users can search by keyword, sort by price, popularity, start or add date, and filter by the season they want to travel. Each tour card contains important information, including location, time remaining in hours and price. And the detailed page of the tour determines exactly what the tour is about, where it starts, what places are visited, or how long it lasts. On this page, users can track the automatically updated remaining time before the start of the tour. And finally book the tour.
